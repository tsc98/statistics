This file has two classes.

1) The first enables a sample to be defined as a class and a Z-Test or a T-Test will then be run
to assess the statistical significance of the sample against the population. The model will dictate which type of test is used
based upon the factors.

2) The second enables an ANOVA test to assess the variance between 3 or more features in a dataset. It takes the sample data and
confidence interval as its primary arguments.
